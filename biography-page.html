        </h2>

        <p style="background: #6D6875; font-family: inherit; font-size: 2em; color: #FFB4A2;">
            My name is Carrie and I&#39;m from Pensacola. I&#39;m currently a sophomore. I do commissions on a website called fiverr and through discord. I love to draw digitally and recently I&#39;ve only been drawing dungeons and dragons characters because of my commissions. I also love video games and anime. My favorite games and anime are: The Witcher 3, Hunter x Hunter, and Monster Hunter: World.

            This is kiki, she&#39;s the biggest cat I&#39;ve ever had. This image makes her look small but she&#39;s really heafty. Like her name says, she is very lazy and will lay down when her sister tries to play with her. Her favorite activities are eating and carrying toys around in her mouth. Kiki still thinks she is a baby and will lick any fluffy blanket while she kneeds it.

            &#9728 Jiji the Destroyer &#9728

            This is jiji, she&#39;s short and chunky. Her favorite thing to do is destroy, she shreds all the toys we buy. Kiki also tears things apart but jiji is crazy. Every morning she sprints around the house at full speed. When she isn&#39;t being crazy, she is sleeping on my bed next to her sister. Her second favorite thing to do is to be under something, like a blanket. You have to be careful about suspicious lumps under covers as they might be jiji.
